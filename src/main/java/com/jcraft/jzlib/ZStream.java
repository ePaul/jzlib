   *<p>
   *  The detailed semantics are as follows. {@code inflate} performs one or
   *  both of the following actions:
   *</p>
   *<ul>
   *  <li>Decompress more input from {@link #next_in}, starting
   *    at {@link #next_in_index}, and update {@link #next_in_index} and
   *    {@link #avail_in} accordingly. If not all input can be processed
   *    (because there is not enough room in the output buffer),
   *    {@link #next_in_index} is updated and processing will resume
   *     at this point for the next call of inflate().</li>
   *  <li>Provide more output in {@link #next_out}, starting
   *     at {@link #next_out_index} and update {@link #next_out_index}
   *     and {@link #avail_out} accordingly. {@code inflate()} provides
   *     as much output as possible, until there is no more input data
   *     or no more space in the output buffer (see below about the
   *     {@code flush} parameter).</li>
   *</ul>
   *<p>
   *  Before the call of {@code inflate()}, the application should ensure
   *  that at least one of the actions is possible, by providing more
   *  input and/or consuming more output, and updating the {code next_*_index}
   *  and {@code avail_*} values accordingly. The application can consume
   *  the uncompressed output when it wants, for example when the output
   *  buffer is full ({@link #avail_out}{@code == 0}), or after each call
   *  of {@code inflate()}. If {@code inflate} returns {@link JZlib#Z_OK Z_OK}
   *  and with zero {@link #avail_out}, it must be called again after
   *  making room in the output buffer because there might be more output
   *  pending.
   *</p>
   *<p>
   *  If a preset dictionary is needed after this call (see
   *  {@link #inflateSetDictionary}), {@code inflate} sets {@link #adler}
   *  to the adler32 checksum of the dictionary chosen by the compressor
   *  and returns {@link JZlib#Z_NEED_DICT Z_NEED_DICT}; otherwise it
   *  sets {@link #adler}
   *  to the adler32 checksum of all output produced so far (that is,
   *  {@link #total_out} bytes) and returns {@link JZlib#Z_OK Z_OK},
   *  {@link JZlib#Z_STREAM_END Z_STREAM_END} or an error code as
   *  described below.
   *  At the end of the stream (for zlib format), {@code inflate()} checks
   *  that its computed adler32 checksum is equal to that saved by the
   *  compressor and returns {@link JZlib#Z_STREAM_END Z_STREAM_END} only if the
   *  checksum is correct.
   *</p>
   *<p>
   *  {@code inflate()} will decompress and check either zlib-wrapped
   *   or plain deflate data, depending on the inflateInit method used
   *  (and its {@code nowrap} parameter).
   *</p>
   * @param flush one of
   *    {@link JZlib#Z_NO_FLUSH Z_NO_FLUSH},
   *    {@link JZlib#Z_SYNC_FLUSH Z_SYNC_FLUSH}, and
   *    {@link JZlib#Z_FINISH Z_FINISH}.
   * <p>
   *  {@link JZlib#Z_NO_FLUSH Z_NO_FLUSH} is the usual value for
   *  non-interactive usage.
   * </p>
   * <p>
   *  {@link JZlib#Z_SYNC_FLUSH Z_SYNC_FLUSH} requests that {@code inflate()}
   *  flush as much output as possible to the output buffer.
   * </p>
   * <p>
   *  {@code inflate()} should normally be called until it returns
   *  {@link JZlib#Z_STREAM_END Z_STREAM_END} or an error. However if
   *  all decompression is to be performed in a single step (a single
   *  call of {@code inflate}), the parameter {@code flush} should be set
   *  to {@link JZlib#Z_FINISH Z_FINISH}.
   *  In this case all pending input is processed and all pending output
   *  is flushed; {@link #avail_out} must be large enough to hold all
   *  the uncompressed data. (The size of the uncompressed data may have
   *  been saved by the compressor for this purpose.) The next operation
   *  on this stream must
   *  be {@link #inflateEnd} to deallocate the decompression state. The use
   *  of {@link JZlib#Z_FINISH Z_FINISH} is never required, but can be
   *  used to inform
   *  {@code inflate} that a faster approach may be used for the single
   *  {@code inflate()} call. 
   *</p>
   *<p>
   * In this implementation, {@code inflate()} always flushes as much output as
   * possible to the output buffer, and always uses the faster approach
   * on the first call. So the only effect of the flush parameter in this
   * implementation is on the return value of {@code inflate()}, as noted
   * below.</p>
   * @return <ul>
   *  <li>{@link JZlib#Z_OK Z_OK} if some progress has been made (more input
   *    processed or more output produced),</li>
   *  <li>{@link JZlib#Z_STREAM_END Z_STREAM_END} if the end of the
   *    compressed data has been reached and all uncompressed output
   *    has been produced (and for the zlib format, the checksum matches),</li>
   *  <li>{@link JZlib#Z_NEED_DICT Z_NEED_DICT} if a preset dictionary is
   *    needed at this point,</li>
   *  <li>{@link JZlib#Z_DATA_ERROR Z_DATA_ERROR} if the input data
   *    was corrupted (input stream not conforming to the zlib format
   *    or incorrect check value),</li>
   *  <li>{@link JZlib#Z_STREAM_ERROR Z_STREAM_ERROR} if the stream structure

   *    or if there was not enough room in the output buffer when

   * </ul>
   * <p>
   *   Note that {@link JZlib#Z_BUF_ERROR Z_BUF_ERROR} is not fatal, and
   *   {@code inflate()} can be called again with more input and more output
   *   space to continue decompressing. If
   *   {@link JZlib#Z_DATA_ERROR Z_DATA_ERROR} is

   *   If not all input can be processed (because there is not enough room in
   *   the output buffer), {@link #next_in_index} and {@link #avail_in} are
   *   updated and processing will resume at this point for the next call
   *   of {@code deflate()}.</li>
   * <li>Provide more output in {@link #next_out}, starting at
   *   {@link #next_out_index} and update {@link #next_out_index} and
   *   {@link #avail_out} accordingly.
   *   This action is forced if the parameter {@code flush} is non zero (i.e.
   *   not {@link JZlib#Z_NO_FLUSH Z_NO_FLUSH}). Forcing flush frequently
   *   degrades the  compression ratio, so this parameter should be set
   *   only when necessary (in interactive applications). Some output may
   *   be provided even if {@code flush} is not set.</li>
   *</ul>
   *<p>
   * Before the call of {@code deflate()}, the application should ensure that
   * at least one of the actions is possible, by providing more input and/or
   * consuming more output, and updating {@link #avail_in} or {@link #avail_out}
   * accordingly; {@link #avail_out} should never be zero before the call.
   * The application can consume the compressed output when it wants, for
   * example when the output buffer is full ({@link #avail_out}{@code == 0}), or
   * after each call of {@code deflate()}. If deflate returns
   *  {@link JZlib#Z_OK Z_OK}
   * and with zero {@link #avail_out}, it must be called again after making room
   * in the output buffer because there might be more output pending.
   *</p>
   * @param flush whether and how to flush output.
   *  <p>
   *   Normally the parameter {@code flush} is set to
   *   {@link JZlib#Z_NO_FLUSH Z_NO_FLUSH},
   *   which allows {@code deflate} to decide how much data to accumulate
   *   before producing output, in order to maximize compression.
   *  </p>
   *  <p>
   *   If the parameter {@code flush} is set to
   *   {@link JZlib#Z_SYNC_FLUSH Z_SYNC_FLUSH}, all
   *   pending output is flushed to the output buffer and the output is
   *   aligned on a byte boundary, so that the decompressor can get all
   *   input data available so far. (In particular {@link #avail_in} is
   *   zero after the call if enough output space has been provided
   *   before the call.) <em>Flushing may degrade compression for some
   *   compression algorithms and so it should be used only when
   *   necessary</em>. This completes the current deflate block and follows
   *   it with an empty stored block that is three bits plus filler bits
   *   to the next byte, followed by four bytes (00 00 ff ff).
   *  </p>

   *   If {@code flush} is set to
   *   {@link JZlib#Z_PARTIAL_FLUSH Z_PARTIAL_FLUSH}, all pending

   *   to a byte boundary. All of the input data so far will be available to
   *   the decompressor, as for {@link JZlib#Z_SYNC_FLUSH Z_SYNC_FLUSH}.
   *   This completes
   *   the current deflate block and follows it with an empty fixed codes
   *   block that is 10 bits long. This assures that enough bytes are output
   *   in order for the decompressor to finish the block before the empty
   *   fixed code block.
   *  </p>
   *  <p>
   *   If {@code flush} is set to {@link JZlib#Z_FULL_FLUSH Z_FULL_FLUSH},
   *   all output is flushed as with {@link JZlib#Z_SYNC_FLUSH Z_SYNC_FLUSH},
   *   and the compression
   *   state is reset so that decompression can restart from this point
   *   if previous compressed data has been damaged or if random access
   *   is desired. Using {@link JZlib#Z_FULL_FLUSH Z_FULL_FLUSH} too
   *   often can seriously degrade compression.
   *   On the decompression side, such reset points can be found with
   *   {@link #inflateSync}.
   *  </p>
   *  <p>
   *   If {@code deflate} returns with {@link #avail_out}{@code == 0}, this
   *   function must be called again with the same value of the {@code flush}
   *   parameter and more output space (updated {@link #avail_out}), until
   *   the flush is complete (deflate returns with non-zero {@link #avail_out}).
   *   In the case of a {@link JZlib#Z_FULL_FLUSH Z_FULL_FLUSH} or
   *   {@link JZlib#Z_SYNC_FLUSH Z_SYNC_FLUSH}, make sure that
   *   {@link #avail_out} is
   *   greater than six to avoid repeated flush markers due to
   *   {@link #avail_out}{@code == 0} on return.
   *  </p>
   *  <p>
   *   If the parameter {@code flush} is set to {@link JZlib#Z_FINISH Z_FINISH},
   *   pending input is processed, pending output is flushed and deflate
   *   returns with {@link JZlib#Z_STREAM_END Z_STREAM_END} if there was
   *   enough output
   *   space; if deflate returns with {@link JZlib#Z_OK Z_OK}, this function
   *   must be called again with {@link JZlib#Z_FINISH Z_FINISH} and more output
   *   space (updated {@link #avail_out}) but no more input data, until
   *   it returns with {@link JZlib#Z_STREAM_END Z_STREAM_END} or an error.
   *   After {@code deflate} has returned
   *   {@link JZlib#Z_STREAM_END Z_STREAM_END}, the only
   *   possible operation on the stream is {@link #deflateEnd}.
   *  </p>
   *  <p>
   *   Z_FINISH can be used immediately after {@link #deflateInit} if all
   *   the compression is to be done in a single step. In this case,
   *   {@link #avail_out} must be large enough to compress everything.
   *   If {@code deflate} does not return
   *    {@link JZlib#Z_STREAM_END Z_STREAM_END},
   *   then it must be called again as described above.
   *  </p>
